# Data-Pipeline-Tool
This repository contains a comprehensive data pipeline tool designed to handle data collection, storage, cleaning, processing, machine learning, and visualization. The pipeline integrates multiple technologies, including React for the front-end, Spring Boot for the backend, Django for the API layer, and PySpark for data processing and ML.

Features
Data Collection

Supports multiple data sources including AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Drive, CSV, and PDF.
Provides a user-friendly interface for selecting and submitting data sources.
Data Storage

Stores collected data in a MySQL database.
Ensures data is stored in a structured format for easy retrieval and processing.
Data Cleaning and Processing

Utilizes PySpark for scalable data cleaning and processing.
Handles large datasets efficiently, preparing them for machine learning.
Machine Learning

Applies machine learning algorithms such as regression and clustering using Spark's MLlib.
Supports scalable machine learning on large datasets.
Data Visualization

Provides visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Displays charts and graphs on a web dashboard created with Flask.
Technologies Used
Front-end: React, Bootstrap
Back-end: Spring Boot, Django
Database: MySQL
Data Processing: PySpark
Machine Learning: Spark's MLlib
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm
Python and pip
Java and Maven
MySQL
Apache Spark
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-pipeline-tool.git
cd data-pipeline-tool
Set up the Front-end:

bash
Copy code
cd my-app
npm install
npm start
Set up the Back-end:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
Set up the Django API:

bash
Copy code
cd django-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
Set up PySpark:

Ensure that PySpark is installed and configured on your system. Refer to the PySpark installation guide for detailed instructions.

Set up Flask for Visualization:

bash
Copy code
cd visualization
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Usage
Data Source Selection:

Open the React front-end.
Select a data source and enter the necessary connection details.
Submit the data source information.
Data Processing and Machine Learning:

The Spring Boot backend forwards the request to the Django API.
The Django API handles data collection from the specified source.
Data is stored in the MySQL database.
PySpark loads data from MySQL, performs cleaning and processing, and applies machine learning algorithms.
Visualization:

Processed data and results from machine learning algorithms are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Open the Flask dashboard to view various charts and graphs.
